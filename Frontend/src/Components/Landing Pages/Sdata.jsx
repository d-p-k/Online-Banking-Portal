        1. Purpose: The primary purpose of a savings account is to provide a
        safe place for individuals to store their money while earning interest
        on the balance.
        {"\n\n"}
        2. Interest: Savings accounts typically offer a modest interest rate on
        the deposited funds. The interest earned is usually calculated on a
        daily or monthly basis and added to the account balance periodically,
        allowing the money to grow over time.
        {"\n\n"}
        3. Liquidity: Savings accounts provide a high level of liquidity,
        meaning you can easily access your funds whenever you need them.
        Withdrawals can usually be made in person at a bank branch, through
        ATMs, online banking, or by writing a check, depending on the bank's
        policies.
        {"\n\n"}
        4. Minimum Balance: Some savings accounts may require a minimum balance
        to open the account or to avoid monthly maintenance fees. The minimum
        balance requirement can vary from bank to bank, so it's important to
        check the specific terms and conditions.
        {"\n\n"}
        5. Deposit Limits: There might be limitations on the maximum amount you
        can deposit into a savings account, although these limits are typically
        quite high.

        daily, and transaction management systems ensure smooth and timely
        processing. This includes updating account balances, verifying
        transaction details, and facilitating the transfer of funds.
        {"\n\n"}
        4. Transaction Monitoring and Reporting: Banks monitor transactions for
        compliance with regulatory requirements and reporting obligations. They
        maintain transaction logs and records, which can be used for auditing,
        regulatory reporting, and analysis.

        5. Secure Authentication and Authorization: Transaction management
        involves ensuring secure authentication and authorization protocols to
        protect customer information and prevent unauthorized access to
        accounts. Banks use multi-factor authentication, encryption, and other
        security measures to safeguard transactions.
